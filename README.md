# Flyer Core — Self-Hostable Micro-Knowledge Engine

**Flyer Core** is a blazing-fast, self-hostable backend that ingests content from any source, distills it into bite-sized knowledge, and serves it through clean APIs.  
Built with **Spring Boot** and compiled using **GraalVM Native Image**, Flyer Core runs anywhere — from a Raspberry Pi to production cloud infra.

It’s not an app.  
It’s *infrastructure for knowledge*.

  - Create one-line knowledge cards
  - Generate summaries
  - Auto-tag topics
- Stores and serves:
  - Knowledge cards
  - Feeds
  - Topics
  - History & metadata
- Exposes a clean REST API for:
