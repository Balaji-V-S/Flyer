# Project Zero

Project Zero is a science-based mobile app built with Flutter to help people quit both smoking and vaping.  
It combines evidence-based behavioral support, personalized quit plans, and simple progress tracking to make the journey to a nicotine-free life easier and more effective.  

The app is currently in research and development, with ongoing studies to validate its effectiveness.  
An alpha version will be rolling out soon for early testing and feedback.
